## Description
The motivation for this project was my desire to showcase what I have learned. Although you see two handfuls of commits, this project took me a while to complete and I had to start over and did this project on different files many times. On this project I struggled alot with the sequencing and getting the project to reset properly. However I did over come it after many hours of labor and watching youTube.
